# learn-ruby-rails 
Various Ruby, Rails, RSpec tutorials and code-alongs

## [Ruby-Todos-testing-pluralsight](../../../Todos-testing-pluralsight)
Oct 2021 - Pluralsight course showing some debugging techniques

## [Ruby-gems-bootcamp](../../../ruby-gems-bootcamp) - Yaroslav Shmarov 
Sep 2021 - This is a udemy course to implement several login systems using auth2. WIP

## Head-first Ruby
Sep 2021 - I've been reading this book over the past month or so. It is great for highlighting features that were kind of glossed over in other courses, e.g., blocks. Or that I missed as a newby.

## [Stridecatcher](../../../rails-stridecatcher)  - Polito WIP
2021 - I am adding in RSpec tests, CI

## [Rest API with Ruby on Rails](../../../rails-rubyflow-clone-API) - Wilgosz WIP
2021 - This was a udemy course I took in 2021 to learn how to develop an API using TDD in RSpec. It was put on pause when I got hung up in order to focus on refreshing React for a side project. It's an older course that had the first part updated, and there are some missing videos / poor explanations in the transition.

## [RubyGems]() - Yaroslav Shmarov WIP
2021 - I signed up for this course to learn to use some gems that were giving me trouble. I was building a project to track updates that I wanted to make to my Element (a camping car), but unfortunately a deer and I had an impact and we both lost, so I stopped that project. I will pick this back up when I have time.

Mar 2021 - Switched focus to learning React and tying in to backend

Somewhere around here, I came across Andy Leverenz, web-crunch.com. I started doing some of his codealongs, which were great to have a different perspective than the Udemy courses I'd taken. However, many are dated and now require a lot of research to get to work.

## [FoodLog](../../../rails-foodlog)
Jan 2021 - I've made some updates to the UI.
Uses Bulma as UI, with some tests. This was my first introduction to testing in rails.

## [Overtime](../../../rails-overtime) - Hudgens WIP
This followed a slightly dated [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-ruby-on-rails-coding-course/) to learn RSpec. I used TDD to build a system to track employees' overtime hours on a weekly basis.  It was then applied to all of the company's employees. It was originally written in Rails 4. I made updates as I went along.

## JavaScript and Ruby on Rails with React, Angular, and Vue - Hossen and Evgeny
I wanted to see how to implement a JS front end to the Rails backend. This was a very dated course, but covered the 3 main frameworks/libraries. I figured it would build on what I had already made in the Mashrur's other course.
[Vue2 ToDO](../../../rails-vue-todo)

## [Rspec](../../../ruby-rspec-example) - Lynda.com

I had an issue building the scheduled tweet project, and decided I needed to learn how to do tests in Rails.

## [Buffer clone](../../../rails-buffer-clone) - GoRails
Feb 2021 - Programmatically schedule and publish tweets. Use Twitter and Twilio APIs, Sidekiq

## The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course - Mashrur Hossain
In Dec 2020, I decided to try out a rails project after working in c# for a while. I loved it! and signed up for this course to learn more. 


[Blog-first project](../../../alpha-blog)

[MessageMe](../../../rails5-message-me) Second app, uses Action Cable

[FinanceTracker](rails6-finance-tracker) Third project, meant to show how quickly one can build with RoR. Uses an API, devise for auth

## Build A Weather App With Ruby On Rails - Codemy
I came across this while on another course platform, and built a few projects from the youtube channel. It uses scaffolding and doesn't seem the best organized, I might go back and reorganize.

## ruby-practice 
Repo to upload some of the initial Skillshare and
