# learn-ruby-rails 
Various Ruby, Rails, RSpec tutorials and code-alongs

## [Ruby-gems-bootcamp](../../../ruby-gems-bootcamp) - Yaroslav Shmarov 
SEP 2021 - This is a udemy course to build a several login systems using auth2. WIP

## Head-first Ruby
Sep 2021 - I've been reading this book over the past month or so. It is great for highlighting features that were kind of glossed over in outher courses, e.g., blocks. Or that I missed as a newby.

## Stridecatcher - Polito WIP

## [Rest API with Ruby on Rails](../../../rails-rubyflow-clone-API) - Wilgosz WIP
2021 - This was a udemy course I took in 2021, but put on puase when I got hung up, and to focus on refreshing React for a side project.

## [RubyGems]() - Yaroslav Shmarov WIP
I signed up for this course to learn to use some gems that were giving me trouble. I was building a project to track updates that I wanted to make to my Element (a camping car), but unfortunately a deer and I had an impact and we both lost, so I stopped that project. I will pick this back up when I have time.

Somewhere around here, I came across Andy Leverenz, web-crunch.com. I started doing some of his codealongs, which were great to have a different perspective than the Udemy courses I'd taken. However, many are dated and now require a lot of research to get to work.

## [FoodLog](../../../ails-foodlog)
Jan 2021 - I've made some updates to the UI.
Uses Bulma as UI, with some tests. This was my first introduction to testing in rails.

## Professional Rails Codealong - Hudgens WIP
This is a slightly dated tutorial to learn RSpec. I made updates as I went along

## JavaScript and Ruby on Rails with React, Angular, and Vue - Hossen and Evgeny
This was a very dated course, but I figured it would build on what I had already made in the Mashrur's other course.

## [Rspec](../../../ruby-rspec-example) - Lynda.com

## The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course - Mashrur Hossain
In Dec 2020, I decided to try out a rails project after working in c# for a while. I loved it! and signed up for this course to learn more. 


[Blog-first project](../../../alpha-blog)

[MessageMe](../../../rails5-message-me) Second app, uses Action Cable

[FinanceTracker](rails6-finance-tracker) Third project, meant to show how quicly one can build with RoR. Uses an API, devise for auth

## Build A Weather App With Ruby On Rails - Codemy
I came across this while on another course platform, and built a few projects from the youtube channel. It uses scaffolding and doesn't seem the best organized, I might go back and reorganize.
